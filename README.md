# **Innovative Scratch Projects Assignment**

## **Objective**

Create a Scratch project by choosing **one** of the options below. Your project must incorporate the following programming concepts:

- **Sprites**
- **Functions (Custom Blocks)**
- **Events**
- **Values (Variables)**
- **Conditions (If Statements)**
- **Loops**

## **Project Options**

### **Option 1: Animated Art or Drawing Program**

**Description:**

Develop a simple drawing application or create an animated art piece that generates patterns or visual effects.

**Guidelines:**

- **Sprites:**
  - Create a sprite for the drawing tool (e.g., a pen or brush).
  - Include sprites for different shapes or patterns if applicable.
- **Events:**
  - Use the `when this sprite clicked` or `when key pressed` events to change drawing modes or tools.
  - Use `when green flag clicked` to initialize your program.
- **Values (Variables):**
  - Create variables to control color, size, or type of brush.
  - Use variables to keep track of drawing modes (e.g., free draw, shape draw).
- **Conditions:**
  - Use `if` statements to check which drawing mode is active.
  - Implement conditions to prevent drawing outside the canvas area.
- **Loops:**
  - Use loops to create repeating patterns or shapes.
  - Implement loops for continuous drawing while the mouse is pressed.
- **Functions (Custom Blocks):**
  - Create custom blocks like `drawShape` or `changeBrush` to organize your code.
- **Additional Features:**
  - Allow the user to clear the screen.
  - Add a color palette for the user to choose colors.
  - Include an eraser tool.

### **Option 2: Educational Quiz or Trivia Game**

**Description:**

Create an interactive quiz that tests knowledge on a subject of your choice.

**Guidelines:**

- **Sprites:**
  - Create sprites for questions, answer options, and feedback messages.
  - Use a background that fits your quiz theme.
- **Events:**
  - Use `when this sprite clicked` events for answer choices.
  - Start the quiz with `when green flag clicked`.
- **Values (Variables):**
  - Use a variable to keep track of the player's score.
  - Use variables to store the current question number.
- **Conditions:**
  - Use `if` statements to check if the selected answer is correct.
  - Provide feedback based on the player's answer (correct or incorrect).
- **Loops:**
  - Use a loop to cycle through all the questions in your quiz.
- **Functions (Custom Blocks):**
  - Create custom blocks like `askQuestion` or `showFeedback` to simplify your code.
- **Additional Features:**
  - Include at least 5 different questions.
  - Provide a final score at the end of the quiz.
  - Add sounds or animations to enhance the experience.

### **Option 3: Reaction Time Tester**

**Description:**

Build a game that measures how quickly the player can respond to visual or auditory stimuli.

**Guidelines:**

- **Sprites:**
  - Create a sprite that signals when the player should react (e.g., changes color, appears/disappears).
- **Events:**
  - Use `when this sprite clicked` or `when key pressed` to record the player's reaction.
  - Start the test with `when green flag clicked`.
- **Values (Variables):**
  - Create a variable to store the player's reaction time.
  - Keep track of the best (fastest) reaction time.
- **Conditions:**
  - Use `if` statements to determine if the player clicked too early.
  - Provide feedback if the player reacts too soon or too late.
- **Loops:**
  - Use loops to repeat the test multiple times.
- **Functions (Custom Blocks):**
  - Create custom blocks like `startTest` or `recordReactionTime` for clarity.
- **Additional Features:**
  - Randomize the time before the signal appears to prevent anticipation.
  - Display the player's reaction time after each test.
  - Include a summary of results at the end.

### **Option 4: Maze Generator and Solver**

**Description:**

Design a program that generates a maze and lets the player navigate through it.

**Guidelines:**

- **Sprites:**
  - Create a sprite for the player character.
  - Design sprites or use backdrops for maze walls and the goal point.
- **Events:**
  - Use `when key pressed` events to move the player sprite.
  - Initialize the maze with `when green flag clicked`.
- **Values (Variables):**
  - Keep track of the player's position if needed.
  - Use variables to count the number of steps taken or time elapsed.
- **Conditions:**
  - Use `if` statements to prevent the player from moving through walls.
  - Check if the player has reached the goal.
- **Loops:**
  - Use loops to generate the maze layout if implementing procedural generation.
  - Implement loops for continuous movement while a key is pressed (optional).
- **Functions (Custom Blocks):**
  - Create custom blocks like `generateMaze` or `movePlayer` for organization.
- **Additional Features:**
  - Add multiple levels with increasing difficulty.
  - Include obstacles or enemies that the player must avoid.
  - Implement a timer to challenge the player to complete the maze quickly.
